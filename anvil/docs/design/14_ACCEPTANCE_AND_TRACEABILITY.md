# 14 — Acceptance and traceability

This matrix maps intended behavior to executable evidence and task status.
Completed historical milestones remain listed; the M10/M11 rows closed with
the T-M10-013 and T-M11-009 acceptance gates.

## Schema-v2 authoring and ARPG

| Acceptance id | Evidence | Tasks | Current status |
|---------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| AU01 Manifest/intent parse | schema unit tests | T-M10-001 | Pass |
| AU02 Declarative source parse | schema + compiler tests | T-M10-002 | Pass |
| AU03 Deterministic immutable IR | compiler repeat/hash/freeze tests | T-M10-003 | Pass |
| AU04 Composition and reference errors | compiler merge/cycle/conflict tests | T-M10-004 | Pass |
| AU05 Migration preview/write/idempotence | migration tests | T-M10-005 | Pass as library API |
| AU06 Machine-readable capabilities | capability/compiler tests | T-M10-006 | Pass as library API |
| AU07 Browser IR parity | Vite bridge tests and Gravewake build | T-M10-007,T-M11-004 | Pass |
| AU08 Agent CLI projections | CLI integration tests | T-M10-008 | Pass |
| AU09 Schema-v2 starter/default examples | CLI integration + example matrix | T-M10-009,010 | Pass |
| AU10 Generic verification compiles intent/rules | CLI integration | T-M10-011 | Pass (validate/test/dev gate schema-v2 projects through `compileProject`; v1 skips per S-AUTHORING §2) |
| AR01 Deterministic ARPG materialization | genre-arpg unit tests | T-M11-001 | Pass |
| AR02 Finite rule execution and observation | genre-arpg unit tests + Gravewake tests | T-M11-002,005 | Pass |
| AR03 Restricted title hook | genre-arpg tests + API review | T-M11-003 | Pass |
| AR04 Generic ARPG loading/scaffold | CLI integration tests | T-M11-006,007 | Pass |
| GATE Complete repo verification | `pnpm check` | T-M10-013,T-M11-009 | Pass (root suite includes authoring + genre-arpg; Gravewake `tyrant_edge` `critMult` content fix landed; full aggregate green) |

## GameCraft-style criteria

| Desideratum | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Engine grounding | Executable hello projects and Gravewake |
| Artifact completeness | Schema-v1 CLI starters; schema-v2 completeness demonstrated by Gravewake |
| Interactive verification | Scenario tests, semantic agent actions, observe/diff/replay |
| Intent traceability | Schema-v2 `game.spec.yaml` requirements and compiled source hash |
